üì¶ How to Install: Minecraft RCON GUI (aka the "We-Made-It-Easy" Edition)

    Download the .exe
    It's just one file, don't worry, no extra nonsense. Just click the Download Link.

    Run the .exe
    No, really. That's it. Just double-click it. Your computer won‚Äôt explode, I promise.

    Connect to Your Server
    Open the app, throw in your server‚Äôs IP, RCON password, and hit Connect. (No need to memorize a ton of stuff. It's a GUI, not a science exam.)

    Hit STOP or RESTART
    Wanna turn off your server? Hit STOP.
    Wanna make it go on a rollercoaster ride? Hit RESTART.
    Simple, right?

    Check the Stats
    Player count? Check.
    Your server‚Äôs RAM and CPU usage? Check.
    You'll have more stats than you can shake a Minecraft stick at.

    Send Commands (Optional)
    Want to spam the server with commands? Just type it in and hit Send. Yes, it‚Äôs that easy.

üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting:

    Q: I can‚Äôt run the .exe!
    A: Check your antivirus. It‚Äôs probably trying to protect you from all that power.

    Q: How do I exit the app?
    A: The red X in the corner works. (You can also just press Alt + F4, but we like to keep it casual.)

Enjoy managing your Minecraft server without dealing with a million windows or lines of code. Just download, click, and play!


‚ò†Ô∏è If You Want to Die License (aka, The "I Dare You" License)

Warning:
By using this version of the software, you're agreeing to the following terms ‚Äî which may cause unnecessary headaches, spontaneous confusion, and an irrational sense of responsibility. Proceed only if you really, really want to.

    Installation Madness

        Step 1: Clone this repository (or download the files, whichever feels like a life decision).

        Step 2: Run this command (you better have Python installed):

        pip install -r requirements.txt

        Step 3: Say goodbye to your free time and hello to command line errors that might haunt you forever.

    If you don't know what any of that means, good luck.

    Customization Mayhem

        You can change the code, tinker with the settings, and even break it all if you want.

        Remember: This is a "modify at your own risk" deal. If it blows up your computer or your sense of well-being, don't come crying to me. (But please, tell me if you make it better.)

    Use at Your Own Peril

        Feel free to use this software in any way you please. But if things go wrong (and they will), don't blame me. I'm just here to provide you with an opportunity to ruin your life‚Äîerr, I mean, enjoy the software.

    Spontaneous Reboots

        If you hit STOP or RESTART, the server will obey. It will either stop peacefully or restart like a rebellious teenager. You may lose progress, or you may feel powerful. That‚Äôs your journey.

    About the Code

        This code is written in Python. If you don't know how to handle Python, I suggest you Google the errors (or YouTube it). Don't bother asking me unless you're ready for a flood of sarcastic responses.

    Disclaimers

        I, the author, am not responsible for any loss of data, sleep, or sanity.

        Use this code if you enjoy chaos.

        Take responsibility for your actions, or be forever haunted by your own decisions.

üõ†Ô∏è Installation (Because Why Not?)

    Clone or download this repository.

    Open the terminal or command prompt.

    Run the following:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Run main.py (don't ask questions, just run it).

    If you made it this far... Congratulations, you‚Äôre still alive. But just wait, the fun is only beginning.

üéâ The End (or is it?)

By continuing, you acknowledge that you are fully responsible for everything that happens.
Feel free to make this your own or burn it to the ground. Either way, you‚Äôve made your choice.

Disclaimer: If you die of laughter or frustration, I am in no way legally liable for your actions.
