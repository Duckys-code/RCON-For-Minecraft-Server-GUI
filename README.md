üì¶ How to Install: Minecraft RCON GUI (aka the "We-Made-It-Easy" Edition)

    Download the .exe
    It's just one file, don't worry, no extra nonsense. Just click the Download Link.

    Run the .exe
    No, really. That's it. Just double-click it. Your computer won‚Äôt explode, I promise.

    Connect to Your Server
    Open the app, throw in your server‚Äôs IP, RCON password, and hit Connect. (No need to memorize a ton of stuff. It's a GUI, not a science exam.)

    Hit STOP or RESTART
    Wanna turn off your server? Hit STOP.
    Wanna make it go on a rollercoaster ride? Hit RESTART.
    Simple, right?

    Check the Stats
    Player count? Check.
    Your server‚Äôs RAM and CPU usage? Check.
    You'll have more stats than you can shake a Minecraft stick at.

    Send Commands (Optional)
    Want to spam the server with commands? Just type it in and hit Send. Yes, it‚Äôs that easy.

üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting:

    Q: I can‚Äôt run the .exe!
    A: Check your antivirus. It‚Äôs probably trying to protect you from all that power.

    Q: How do I exit the app?
    A: The red X in the corner works. (You can also just press Alt + F4, but we like to keep it casual.)

Enjoy managing your Minecraft server without dealing with a million windows or lines of code. Just download, click, and play!
